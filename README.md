# Advanced Control Methods 2025

This repository contains materials for the Advanced Control Methods course.

## Repository Structure

*   `/seminars`: Contains materials for each seminar, including Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), theoretical notes (`.md` files where applicable), source code (`src/`), and images (`img/`). Each seminar directory has its own `README.md` detailing its content.
*   `/lectures`: Intended for lecture slides or notes.

## Notation Convention

Throughout the seminars and lectures, the following general notation is used where applicable:

*   $\mathbf{s}$: State vector of the system.
*   $a$: Control input signal.
*   $L$: Lyapunov function candidate.

## Welcome Note
